This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle bug in VHDL code involving the implicit conversion between integers and std_logic_vectors.  The original code ('buggy_counter.vhdl') attempts to assign an integer signal to an output port declared as an integer, but synthesis tools might interpret this differently, leading to unexpected behavior or synthesis errors. The solution ('buggy_counter_fixed.vhdl') explicitly handles the conversion to prevent potential errors.
